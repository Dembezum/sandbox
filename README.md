sole purpose is to test and experiment with different technologies, tools and

# Navigation the repository

The repository is structured in a way that makes it easy to navigate and find
the information you need. Here's a brief overview of the structure:

Right now you're reading the "root", of the repository. This is where you'll
see the projects directory and this README.md file. Each Readme file in the
respective project directory will contain a brief overview of the project, its
objectives, and any other relevant information. You can navigate to a specific
project by clicking on the project name in the list below:

- [Projects](https://github.com/Dembezum/sandbox/tree/main/Projects/Proj1)

In Each project directory, you'll find other directories that contain specific
information about the project. For example, the
[Networking](https://github.com/Dembezum/sandbox/tree/main/Projects/Proj1/Networking)
directory in the project directory will contain information about the
networking setup for that project.
